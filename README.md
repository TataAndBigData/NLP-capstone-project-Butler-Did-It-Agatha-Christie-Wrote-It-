Summary:
My project is dedicated to the classification problem: here I predict the author of a detective novel by the given paragraph. The following document will introduce the dataset and models I used, my challenges and key findings. This is a learning project, so it has not been designed for the practical application. However, the conclusions can be used for other classification problems as well.
